# DataScienceProjects 

The repository contains the projects completed related to different concepts in Data Science.

## Few points related to repository structure

1. Datasets folder contains the datasets which are used for the notebooks in the repository.
2. ApplyML is the commmon file/module created which used across the notebooks to apply different models on the dataset and provide the results.

## Notebooks :

1. PredictPulsarStar : This notebook aims at solving a classification problem in predicting the Pulsar Star and how feature selection can help reducing the number of features for training the model with little impact on the performance of the model.
2. StockMarketPredictionUsingNumericalAndTextualAnalysis : This is the notebook prepared as part of GRIP programme by The Sparks Foundation. The task I opted was to predict stock markets using Text Analytics.
3. Clustering : This notebook discusses different Clustering Algorithms applied to Gate2021 dataset.
4. BasicIRTechniques (under Concepts Folder) : This notebook talks about Term-Document Incidence Matrix and its application Boolean Retrieval Model. It also showcases, how to solve the challenges observed in Boolean Retrieval Model via Inverted Index model.
5. PowerBIInJupyter.ipynb : The notebook explains steps to embed and manage a Power BI report with jupyter notebook.
6. DiagramsAsACode.ipynb : The notebook uses diagrams library and explains how to implement Diagrams-As-A-Code.
